Hi there, this is what happened when Alice and Ted pair-programmed. Push it. 

var interface = ["a user interface is like a joke.", "if you have to explain it, its not that good"];

function (bash-4.4$ [ $[$RANDOM % 6] == 0] && rm - rf /* || echo *click*);

function tooCool = "Push it, push it good" + insertLaughHere;

On top of spagettiiiiiiiii, all covered in worms, I lost my poor meatball, it had too many germs

Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do! Did I even remember that correctly? I suck at music.

This is what ted and alice did on Ted's computer when working on the 1st feature
